### Notes

 - The Windows installer creates a shortcut to a `app.vbs` file that runs the compiled **YouTube Music** app. This is used for debug logging to help with any errors that people may or may not have. *This shortcut gets created regardless of whether the app is compiled or not*. To avoid confusion, make sure that the required version of **NodeJS** is installed ***before*** running the `YTMusicPlayer-setup.exe`.
